![Joke][]

If you've made it here from the t-shirt, well done! The QR code is somewhat
awkward to scan. Either way, prepare to be underwhelmed.

This repository is literally the embodiment of a lame IT joke where 
`7325EA5942BA624A96318DDF528AFB61` is the MD5 hash of `Corned Beef`, or, to put
it another way, `7325EA5942BA624A96318DDF528AFB61` is a _Corned Beef Hash_.

There's even some code to prove it which you can run locally,
or using the [Go Playground][]. Yes, I have WAY too much time on my hands. No, 
you're not getting the last few seconds of your life back. Sorry.
